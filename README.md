# Obsidian group Snippet

This plugin allow you to set group of CSS snippets to class them and enable them in one click (or command).

## Usage

1. Go to the Settings of the plugin
2. Add a group (clicking on the + button)
3. Add a name to the group
4. Click on the `edit` button to add CSS snippets to the group

After this, you have your group of CSS snippets ! 🎉🎉

So, now, to enable the group, run the command `obsidian group enable group_name`. This commands will enable every snippets "enabled" ! You can check your Appearance tab if you need to check.

🗒️ Some notes : You need to reload the snippets (using the button refresh) when you remove snippets. But, no worry, the plugin can't activate snippet that doesn't exist ! It's just the list that need some refreshing :).
